A collection of a website where I edited and/or created a navigation bar using the header and footer features of HTML5. 
--The school website you see here is actually the school I received my professional certificate in Software Development.
--I had a lot of fun with this as I was able to work my magic using JavaScript, for website animation and behaviors based on user interaction, HTML5 and CSS3, for the structure of content and making it look presentable, and troubleshooting a little bit of JavaScript so the buttons would work and we had less files to deal with. 

Hope you enjoy it and if any questions feel free to reach out to me.
